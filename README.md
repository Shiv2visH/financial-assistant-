## **Technology Stack**  

### **Backend (Python - Flask)**  
- **Framework:** Flask (Lightweight web framework)  
- **CORS Handling:** `flask-cors` for frontend-backend communication  
- **Data Storage:** JSON file (`financial_data.json`)  
- **Endpoints:**  
  - `GET /api/data` ‚Üí Load saved financial data  
  - `POST /api/data` ‚Üí Save new financial data  
  - `GET /api/budget` ‚Üí Calculate budget summary  

### **Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**  
- **UI Structure:** Simple, responsive form-based interface  
- **Dynamic Updates:** Real-time budget calculations  
- **User Experience:**  
  - Clean, intuitive design  
  - Error handling with alerts  
  - Progress tracking

## **How It Works**  

### **1. User Input**  
- Enter **name, income, expenses, debts, and savings goals**.  
- The app stores this data in a JSON file.  

### **2. Budget Calculation**  
- The backend computes:  
  - **Total expenses**  
  - **Remaining balance**  
  - **Budget health status** (Healthy, Warning, Danger)  

### **3. Financial Advice**  
- Based on income vs. expenses, the app suggests:  
  - **Savings targets** (e.g., 3-6 months of emergency funds)  
  - **Debt repayment strategies** (focus on high-interest debts first)  
  - **Investment tips** (if savings are sufficient)  

### **4. Data Persistence**  
- All data is saved in `financial_data.json` and reloaded when the app restarts.
